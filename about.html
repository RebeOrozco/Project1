        ABOUT ME!

      <p>Hello, my name is Rebecca Orozco. <br>Growing up I was always drawn to the wonderful world of creativity. 
        I have always loved to learn new crafts and art skills. My love for art started when I was 
        younger having to spend my summer at summer camps where we would often do arts and craft. As time went on, 
      I got introduced to social media which showed me so much more art and crafty activities from all over the world. 
      I was in awe and inspired. 
        <br>With my love of creating and picking up different art related hobbies I 
      decided to pursue Architecture my first year at UNLV. Let's just say it was a learning experience and I'm 
      glad I followed a different path. I realized Graphic Design was what I wanted to do and ever since, it has been 
      a bit stressful at times, but it ha been so fun and worth it. </p>

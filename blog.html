      <p>2024 <br>Digital Drawing</p>
      <p>I enjoy studying the art of drawing faces. 
        Here I practiced capturing the real likeness of a Kpop idol named Choi Beomgyu. 
        In this drawing I focused on using lines to measure out the right places where the facial features belonged. 
        I also played around with a pen like brush to create detailed little strokes to pull the piece together. 
        I also experimented with the background colors and blurs to make my subject appear to be glowing.</p>

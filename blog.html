        <i>Likeness Practice</i>
      </h3>
      <p>2024 <br>Digital Drawing</p>
      <p>I enjoy studying the art of drawing faces. 
        Here I practiced capturing the real likeness of a Kpop idol named Choi Beomgyu. 
        In this drawing I focused on using lines to measure out the right places where the facial features belonged. 
        I also played around with a pen like brush to create detailed little strokes to pull the piece together. 
        I also experimented with the background colors and blurs to make my subject appear to be glowing.</p>

        <i>Band Tour Poster</i>
      </h3>
      <p>2025 <br>Digital Design</p>
      <p>Here I designed a Tour poster for the Kpop group, BTS' last tour in 2021-2022. I drew inspiration from the 
      tour's theme of orange and fun shapes. In the poster I wanted to make it inviting for fans and include collage 
      like stickers and confetti like texture in the background. To add more of the band's style, I incorporated their logo 
      as a cut out where the members look like they're popping out from.</p>

        <i>Zine Spread</i>
      </h3>
      <p>2024 <br>Digital Design</p>
      <p>We were tasked to create a zine spread from a made up magazine company. We also needed to have a subject to revolve our spread 
      around and I chose to focus on male fashion. I then centered my made up magazine around my subject with a cool blue and orange color
      palette. I had fun using different fonts and altering my subjects apprearnce either reflecting himself or fading away with the help of Photoshop. </p>
